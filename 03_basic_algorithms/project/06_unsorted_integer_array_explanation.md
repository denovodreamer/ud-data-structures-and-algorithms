**Design Choices:**

This algorithm just goes through every element in the array, keeping the maximum and minimum number.


**Efficiency Analysis:**

The input has n elements, which corresponds to the array length.

Since it traverses the all array one time, the time efficiency is O(n).

For the space efficiency there are no additional data structures, so there is no variation with n, and the efficiency is constant O(1).
